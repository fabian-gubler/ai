### Fintech
#### Information: Business Idea

**General**
- Topic: Trading Insights using Machine Learning in order to filter important information out of huge volume of data
- Purpose: Support existing, experienced trader with an advantage
- Handout: Inform investment decisions by analyzing financial information to forecast business, industry or economic conditions

**From Lecture**
- Jobs - Common theme: Not replacing but supporting
- What type of ML System is best to solve this problem?
- Virtuous Cycle -> Unfair advantage (Arbitrage)
- Operating Model: Easy to see the potential value creation, however, the implementation is difficult and competitive

**Details**
- Insights using ML going through information (such as reports)
- Search Engines are similar, in the sense that they aggregate content and show you what you need to see
- What problem is trying to be solved?
- Different Levels: Information Gathering, Recommendations, Real Time applications 
- Only for big firms (i.e. Alladin) or accessible for everyone
	- Unfair advantage?
- Existing technologies and Future Possibilities
- If everyone has the same technology is there actually value being created? Level playing field.

**Technologies**
- Supervised Learning (Previously Good Trades)
- Reinforced Learning (Punish Bad Trades)
- Unsupervised Learning (Get Context of an undiscovered field)

**Similar**
- Loans (Small Loans from persons instead of firms)
- Trade Bots (Asset Management) for Personal Finance


### User First Approach (aka case against Surveillance Capitalism)

**Content**

- Lex Fridman's Philosophy of Recommender Systems
	- Go away (Press of a button, like data never existed)
	- Transparency of Data usage (That is easily accessible)
	- Personalization of Algorithm's objective function (Intellectual Pursuit, Entertainment, Curiosity etc. )
- Objective Functions
- Data Brokers (Personal Data Companion)

**Approach**


- Provide Context
- Firms incentives
- Present Key Characteristics desirable to Users
- Consequence: Policy Solutions that would achieve
- Risks: Negative Consequences for Supply Side

### Governance of Artificial Intelligence
- Hook: Are we doomed? Is there a silver lining to it?
- AI, Viruses, and Nuclear -> Massive Damage
- AI much smaller barriers than other existential weapons
- Fermi Paradox
- What do we do when it comes to a point where we cannot control the development
- Even with prohibition, the necessary toolset (i.e. computer) will always be there
- Cybersecurity Nation State Threat Actors

### Cybersecurity and AI
- Economic Opportunities
- Threat Actors and Potential Exploits
- This is how they tell me the world ends
- Interesting Market Dynamic of black market
- black hat hackers protected by their government
- Impacts: Industrial Systems (Power Grid, Nuclear, Internet), Intelligence Gathering (Military or Intellectual Property)

### Difficulties of Regulation
- What does a free market lead to?
- Nations outcompeting other nations with laissez faire regulation (e.g. china direct cooperation with their companies)
- Incentives of Companies (Data collection at zero cost, makes sense without even having a use case)
- Social and Economic Dilemmas
	- Negative Consequences for optimizing engagement
	- Be at a disadvantage when not collecting data
