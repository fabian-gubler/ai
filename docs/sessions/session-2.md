# 2: Data and the Global Digital Economy


## Content
- Data as a factor of production
- Digital value chains and digital trade
- Group activity: How businesses monetize data

# Presentation

## Privacy and Data Collection
- Big firms are in favor of regulation
- Small firms less in favor due to cost of compliance

## Data Monetization Strategies
- Business model: Creation (Personalized), Capture (Across many markets)
- Operating model: Scale (Zero Marginal cost), Learning (Constant Optimization)

## Much can go wrong


# Required Readings

## Digital Globalization (Chapter 2)

### Introduction
- Digital economy dominated by small number of firms through gathering information about consumers and monetizing this knowledge through digital services (i.e. data-driven value creation)
- No "proximity burden" for digital services, unlicke physical (e.g. haircuts)
- Increase in digital services (64% current of total service export) and platforms leads to increasing globalization

### Data fules the digital Economy

**Differences to other inputs**

- Property rights difficult to establish and value
- Intangible asses
- No inherent value (derived from insights)
- Non rival (multiple entities can exploit same data), but not a public good
- Non-fungible (datasets, unlike oil, not interchangeable wit another)
- Intimately linked to a subject

**Attractiveness**

- Deeply personal data collected and transmitted at zero cost
- Personal information can lead to discriminatory business practices
- Inexhaustible: Value can be extracted repeatedly and even for different products and services

### Digital Value Chains

- Do not produce goods
- Instead, they represent the process firms use to collect, store, analyze and ultimately generate value by monetizing data
- The more data, the better the predictions

### The Global Digital Giants

- Less global barriers compared to traditional markets (frictions related to distance, like transportation costs)
- Virtuous Cycle: More Users -> Better Product; Better Product -> More Users
- Dominant acquisition strategies driven by competitive threats and need to collect vast amounts of data (Synergy Effects)
- High initial (fixed) cost for software development and digital infrastructure
- Low Marginal Cost to reach new customers

### Political Features of Digital Economy
- Policy is Controversial, especially if firm from other country dominates domestic market (e.g. uber)
- Consumer welfare benefits from these technological innovations (search engines, ecommerce, social media, maps)

**Issues**
- Personal privacy
- Tax fairness
- Inequality
- Automation

**Privacy and Agency**

- Economic Growth at odds with personal privacy (i.e. Surveillance Capitalism)
- Risk of Data breaches of sensitive information
- Billions of IoT devices embedded with data-gathering sensors often connected to the internet
- Firms use data to predict and influence consumer behavior
- Algorithms designed to manipulate consumers become increasingly controversial as users regonize the invasiveness and scope of digital surveillance

**Global Tax Regime**

- Tax avoidance by multinational corporations
- Transfer pricing: Attribute Digital intangibles to low tax countries
- Profit shifting: Shift profit artificially to low-tax countries

## Artificial Intelligence Basics - Data (Chapter 2)

### Big Data

**Context**

- Companies generate huge sums of data
- Large part of value of biggest tech firms comes from their data

**3 Vs**

- Volume: Scale of data (often unstructured)
- Variety: Diversity of data, different sources
- Velocity: Speed of data creation

### Data Process (1-3)

**1. Business Understanding**

- Clear view of the business problem to be solved
- How to measure sucess?
- Technical Needs: Infrastructure and software tools necessary to satisfy objective

**2. Data Understanding**

- What data is necessary to solve the problem
- Easy when working with structured data
- With unstructured need to label data and make sense of it

Three Main sources

- In-House Data (Free and customized ty our business)
- Open Source Data (Freely available)
- Third-Party Data (from commercial vendor)

**3. Data Preparation**

- Decide what Datasets to use (for the goal)
- Cleaning (Duplications, Outliers, Validation)
- Data scientists ~60% of time spent on cleaning data
- More data not always better: Potential Point where data starts to degrade
